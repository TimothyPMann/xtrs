# If you would like the TRS-80 ROM to be built into the application,
# use the following lines (with the appropriate file names).  You can
# get a ROM image from a real TRS-80 with moderate effort, if you have
# one.  There are also Web sites with TRS-80 ROMs that can be
# downloaded, but none are included with this package due to copyright
# concerns.  As another alternative, for -model III or 4, you can
# export the MODELA/III file from a Model III or 4 TRSDOS or
# LDOS/LS-DOS diskette and use it as BUILT_IN_ROM3.

# The default ROM for -model I, III and 4 (fakerom.hex) just prints a
# message saying that you don't have a ROM.  The default ROM for
# -model 4P (xtrsrom4p.hex) is a free minimal ROM that can boot a
# Model 4 mode operating system (such as TRSDOS/LDOS 6); source code
# is included in this package.  This ROM cannot boot a Model III mode
# operating system.

# time, use these lines (with the appropriate file names).  The default file
# name is ignored and can be omitted if the ROM for that model is built in.
