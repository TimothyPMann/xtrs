Notes for compilation under RISC OS
===================================

zmac 1.2 has been compiled and tested on RISC OS 3.71, using
Acorn C/C++ Release 5.  It has not been compiled with gcc, lcc
or Easy C.

To compile with Acorn C/C++ you will need to rename the five
source and header files to place them in directories called
"c" and "h" and create the object directory "o".  Ignore
the supplied Makefile -- it is very easy to build a RISC OS
one using Acorn !Make.  Do not forget to link in C:o.stubs.

A full RISC OS binary distribution, with desktop front end,
is available for download from
